# README – Code Snippets from *F# Intermediate Guide*

## Overview

This repository contains all code snippets extracted from the book **“F# Intermediate Guide”**. The snippets have been organized **chapter by chapter** to help you quickly locate and experiment with the examples that align with specific parts of the text.

Each snippet has been saved as a separate file, with filenames like `snippet_001.idr` or `snippet_002.sh`. File extensions were automatically assigned based on the detected language (e.g., `.idr` for Idris-like code, `.sh` for shell commands, `.ps1` for PowerShell, `.bat` for Windows batch scripts, and `.txt` for plain text when language was uncertain).

## Structure

* Each **chapter** from the book has its own folder.
* Inside each chapter folder, snippets are numbered sequentially in the order they appear.
* The root folder contains this README file and a manifest (`README.md`) listing how many snippets were extracted from each chapter.

Example:

```
/Chapter_1
    snippet_001.idr
    snippet_002.sh
/Chapter_2
    snippet_001.ps1
/Introduction
    snippet_001.txt
README.md
```

## How to Use

1. **Browse by chapter:** Open the relevant folder to find the examples connected to the section you are studying.
2. **Run the code:**

   * For `.idr` files, use an Idris2 compiler.
   * For `.sh` files, run them in a Unix/Linux shell or WSL on Windows.
   * For `.ps1` files, use PowerShell.
   * For `.bat` files, run them in Windows Command Prompt.
3. **Modify and experiment:** These snippets are intended as learning tools. Feel free to extend them and test variations.

## Notes

* The extraction was done automatically. While care was taken to ensure accuracy, some prose may have been included in rare cases, or some snippets may need minor adjustments.
* Code blocks without a clear language signature were saved as `.txt`.
* If you discover that certain snippets should use a different extension, you can rename them for better integration with your tools or IDE.
